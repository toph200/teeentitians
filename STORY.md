Robin tries to blow up the bathroom because everyone is taking too long in it.


START

Robin wakes up and he has to go to the bathroom really badly

He goes to the bathroom door and someone is in it.

When raven comes out, Robin holds a meeting.

Robin talks about how there should be a new rule that everything you need to do in the bathroom should take under 5 minutes, and if you take longer the bathroom blows up.

Then Robin tries to show the others how to get out of the bathroom in less than 5 minutes.

Robin goes to the bathroom, showers, shaves, in less than 5 minutes.

When he was finished he told everyone that, even though he goes to the bathroom in less than 5 minutes, the bathroom still blows up.

Raven asks if there’s any way to disable. Robin says there is not.

Star fire asks why it blows up when it gets to 1. Robin explains that bombs blow up when they get to one “Haven’t you ever seen a bomb when it gets to 1; it blows up!”

When Robin finds out how great the bathroom is he never leaves. When he gets out, all the bathrooms in the world fly out of the houses so that no one can use them anymore.
